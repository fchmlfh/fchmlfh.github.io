My research topic mainly concerns geometry of Shimura varieties and level raising/lowering of automorphic forms.


## Lever lowering for U(1,2)
Mazur's principle provides simple conditions so that an irreducible unramified $\mathbb{F}_\ell$
representation coming from a modular form of level $\Gamma_{0} (Np)$ also comes from a form of level $\Gamma_0 (N)$.
We proof Mazur's principle for $U(1,2)$ by studying the geometry of special fiber of Shimura varieties.

## Project Two
