My research topic mainly concerns geometry of Shimura varieties and level raising/lowering of automorphic forms.


## Lever lowering for U(1,2)
Mazur's principle provides simple conditions so that an irreducible unramified $\mathbb{F}_\ell$
representation coming from a modular form of level \Gamma_{0} (Np) also comes from a form of level $\Gamma_0 (N)$.
We proof Mazur's principle for $U(1,2)$ by studying the geometry of special fiber of Shimura varieties.

## Explicit cycle from higher Chow group and arithmetic level raising for U(1,2)
Using higher Chow group we construct cycles in an explicit manner which realise the arithmetic level raising 
for $U(1,2).$
